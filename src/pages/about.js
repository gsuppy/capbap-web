            Dear Friends of CHBC,
            <p>
            On behalf of the congregation of the Capitol Hill Baptist Church, welcome to our site. We are delighted to share with you some information about us and hope that you find it helpful. This church exists for the glory of God. We believe that we are made expressly to be in a relationship with Him and to recognize Jesus of Nazareth as our Lord and Savior. We strive to bring God glory through singing and praying together, hearing His Word preached, loving Him, and loving one another.
            We are an evangelical community of believers in a needy environment. Our setting has its problems and its opportunities. We cannot be sure what life in the future will bring for us as a church anymore than we know what tomorrow will bring for us as individuals.
            We are nonetheless delighted at the spiritual health God has cultivated here and thankful that He continues to bring committed believers into our fold. It is a blessing to serve God in the mission field of Capitol Hill with these brothers and sisters of all ages, backgrounds, and occupations.
            As a part of our mission, we would love to be of help to you. For that matter, we would love for you to be of help to us, as we serve God with a Christ-centered focus. Whether it is Capitol Hill Baptist, or some place else, pray that God would show you where to commit yourself to His people in His service.
            </p>
            <p>
            In Christ,
            Mark Dever
