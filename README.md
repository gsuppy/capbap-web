# Capitol Hill Baptist Church Web App

This is a progressive single page app bootstrapped using Create-React-App. The hope was to create an app for members of my church so they could better interact with one another, especially during this time of COVID-19. Obviously, creating an entire web app with multiple complex elements is not an easy feat and I was not able to complete everything, mainly the members only section (you can still explore the menu below without technically logging into it).

If you would like to run this code locally on your computer, please run `yarn start` from the root of the capbap-web directory.

Or if you would like to access via your browser, navigate to https://capbap-web.herokuapp.com/

# Explore the App

## Login

Please login via email, Google, or Facebook account. This will technically give you access to the /members page, but that is still a WIP. You can manually navigate to /members to check if your login was successful. The profile button on the top right allows you to click on it and logout if you wish. Additional profile settings are WIP.

## Pages - Home, About, Liste, Pray, Calendar, Donate, Contact

The home, about, and contact pages are mainly static pages taken from details of the existing website for my church.
